# ConvoCam

ConvoCam is a real-time video chat application built with JavaScript, NodeJS, PeerJS, WebRTC, and Socket.io. This project allows users to connect through live video calls, with seamless peer-to-peer communication. The app uses Socket.io for real-time signaling and WebRTC for efficient video and audio streaming directly between users' browsers. The backend is powered by NodeJS, and PeerJS simplifies peer-to-peer connections. The project demonstrates how to build a simple yet powerful video chat solution with modern web technologies.
